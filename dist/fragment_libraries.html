						The fragment-based approach to drug discovery (FBDD) has been established as an efficient tool in the search for new drugs [1,2]. It has emerged as an alternative approach to traditional lead identification via high-throughput screening (HTS). Unlike HTS, FBDD identifies smaller compounds, the “fragments”, which bind to different parts of a biological target. FBDD has several advantages over HTS. The primary rationale for screening fragments is that they give access to a broader chemical space while screening a limited number of compounds. FBDD gives a better chance for the final lead compound to have common drug-likeness parameters. Moreover, the chance of identifying a compound that is a perfect match for the intended target’s binding site is too small to rely on because a multitude of interactions between the ligand and amino acid residues in the active site are often involved. On the other hand, there are simpler molecules (fragments) with fewer unavoidable interactions and, thus, a much better chance of orienting within the binding site in a favorable manner.
					</p>
					<p>
						In response to this evident trend in drug discovery Life Chemicals has designed its
						proprietary Fragment Library containing nearly 68,000 compounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following the most promising current tendencies in fragment based approach to drug
						discovery, Life Chemicals has prepared a selection of its unique subsets given below:

					<p>
						Recent tendencies in drug discovery, however, shift towards aiming at leads with lower
						molecular weight and higher hydrophilicity; it is not surprising, therefore, that even
						more meticulous criteria must be applicable to fragment libraries. In particular, lowering
						upper molecular weight cut-off value (to 200–240 instead of 300) is strived for by many
						companies practicing FBDD.
					</p>
					<p>
						To meet these principles, Life Chemicals has designed its Low MW Fragment Library
						applying a number of physico-chemical filters [1, 2] to its General Fragment Collection.
						Finally, the compounds were passed through MedChem [3] and PAINS [4] structural
						filters. This resulted in a library of more than 3,000 compounds. Although the molecular
						weight is the main parameter which was controlled strictly, other physico-chemical
						characteristics were also well monitored (e. g., more than 80 % of the library has
						ClogP<2). Due to this upgrading a refined set of nearly 1,500 fragments was generated by
						means of more rigorous physico-chemical and structural cut-offs.

					<h5 id="sd-lib" class="green">FRAGMENT LIBRARY WITH EXPERIMENTAL SOLUBILITY DATA</h5>
					<p>
						Solubility of fragments is known to be one of the key features to limit their use in various
						screening techniques of FBDD. Proceeding from this knowledge, Life Chemicals has
						started its project on measuring experimental solubility of proprietary fragment collection.
						The procedure includes visual determination of solubility by observing scattering of
						solutions under the following concentrations:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>200 mM in DMSO</li>
						<li>5 mМ in water phosphate buffer with 2.5 % DMSO</li>
						<li>1 mМ in water phosphate buffer with 0.5 % DMSO</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Life Chemicals Fragment Library with Experimental Solubility Data includes over
						12,800 compounds, mainly from our Advanced Set of The General Fragment Library, with
						confirmed experimental solubility at 200 mM in DMSO and characterized by the data
						available for the above mentioned concentrations in phosphate buffer.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Average MW 240 Da and logP 1.2</li>
						<li>Guaranteed solubility of all compounds in DMSO at high concentration (200 mM)</li>
						<li>77 % of the Library are soluble in water phosphate buffer at 1 mM, and 60 % – at 5 mM</li>
						<li>Compounds were passed through MedChem structural filters worked out by our experts</li>

					<p>
						According to new trends in drug discovery involving comprehensive structural analysis
						of approved drugs and determination of relationships between molecular complexity
						and pharmacological promiscuity of drug-like compounds [1–5], Life Chemicals has
						extrapolated the results of investigations described here to its Fragment Library design.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently it was found that the mean Fsp³ goes up from 0.36 for 2.2 million molecules in
						drug discovery phase to 0.47 for 1,179 approved drugs. Applying the mentioned above
						Fsp³ cut-off to The Life Chemicals General Fragment Library resulted in our Fsp³-enriched
						Fragment Library of more than 11,500 compounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Superposition of sets of the compounds with a relatively high Fsp³ value and filtering
						them by strict “Rule of Three” criteria along with TPSA 90Å2 cut-off gives rise to our
						Advanced Fsp³-enriched Fragment Subset comprising nearly 3,200 compounds. To
						ensure discarding “ugly” compounds, PAINS and our in-house developed toxicophore and
						undesired functionalities filtering were applied as well.

						Crystallographic fragment-based drug discovery is gaining a high importance in modern
						pharmaceutical technology. Fragments, however, are poor binders, with their partial

						The Life Chemicals Bromine Fragment Library consists of about 1,300 compounds with

						It was demonstrated that ¹⁹F NMR-based fragment screening can be used as a very
						efficient tool for rapid and sensitive detection of fragment hits [1]. As shown, although
						the fraction of chemical space covered by fluorine containing fragments may be limited
						compared to that covered by non-fluorinated fragments, similar hit rates are obtained
						applying both methods. At the same time fragment screening with a simple onedimensional
						¹⁹F NMR experiment (with ¹H decoupling) is significantly faster and, in many
						ways, more robust than traditional ¹H-based NMR screening. An in-house developed
						method focuses on the use of a fluorine nucleus as a detection tool, and subsequent to a
						¹⁹F fragment screen, protonated analogues of hit compounds can be mined and pursued
						in initial hit expansion. This approach can significantly add to the chemical space
						explored and provide valuable information and early stage SAR to chemists.

						Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are among the most attractive targets for drug design.
						However, this field of interactions is not well explored and there are no common features
						for all proteins involved in it. Several dozens of protein pairs have been fully investigated
						so far and their crystal structures have revealed the mechanism of tight connection
						between interfaces. These investigations present a hard task consuming too much time
						and effort but they can be facilitated by development of fragment-based library focused
						on inhibition of protein-protein interactions.

					<p>
						It was shown that PPI inhibitors are typically larger and more lipophilic than inhibitors of
						more standard binding sites of most proteins [1]. That’s why PPI fragments have TPSA
						values higher than it was generally claimed when practicing a common approach to
						fragment-based drug design. The same applies to molecular weight of compounds that
						should be between 250 and 450 Da. Thus, such compounds cannot fit a standard “Rule
						of Three” usually used for selection of fragments. It was found that small molecules
						targeting PPI have highly hydrophobic core within peripheral lipophilic substituents [2].
						To enhance selectivity we have proposed very reasonably chosen hydrophobic and more
						spatial structures (sp³-enriched).
					</p>
					<p>
						The main result of compilation of the features mentioned above is a special chemical
						space for compounds with a common function of PPI interaction inhibition. One more
						detail that characterizes PPI fragments is the principal moment of inertia (PMI). Mean
						values of npr1 = 0.28, npr2 = 0.88 show the distribution of compounds in 3D space and
						evaluate 3D-shape diversity [3]. Finally, the compounds were passed through PAINS filter.
					</p>
					<p>
						More than 2,500 compounds were extracted into The Life Chemicals PPI Fragment Library.

					<p>
						The vast majority of existing drugs has
						centered on sp2-rich aromatic core [1,2].
						Moreover, we could often find the same
						core fragment in several drugs with
						different targeted diseases that leads to
						a low specificity (selectivity) and the rise
						of side effects. Although most fragment
						libraries are diverse, having been refined to
						contain a good balance of properties, they
						all tend to have a limited shape diversity
						[5]. In this context it has been established
						that a higher three-dimensionality (3D)
						of molecules is a desirable feature of
						drug candidates and is correlated with
						successful passage of molecules at various
						stages of clinical development. The use of
						more complex and sp3-rich (more 3D-like)
						fragments would undoubtedly build up the
						drug-like fragment chemical space that
						might in turn be advantageous in exploring
						more demanding biological targets.
					</p>
					<p>
						In view of the above, we have carefully
						designed our drug-like 3D Fragment Library using physico-chemical properties
						and descriptors that allow to evaluate
						3D-dimensionality and diversity of the
						molecules. The “Rule of Three” with a
						number of filtering criteria enabling
						successful 3D library design was applied
						to The Life Chemicals Stock Fragment
						Collection. Principal moments of inertia
						(PMI) [3,6] calculation was used as an
						efficient method to calculate and evaluate
						3D-dimensionality. Proper diversity levels
						of the library were proved by applying
						max Tanimoto coefficient of diversity 85 %
						(linear fingerprints were used). Undesirable
						functionalities were eliminated by applying
						PAINS and our special in-house medicinal
						chemistry filters. Totally 1,500 fragments
						were chosen. The following basic
						criteria were used to improve 3D shape
						functionality of fragments in our library:

					<h5 id ="cov-lib" class="green">COVALENT FRAGMENT LIBRARY</h5>
					<p>
						In recent years, the number of drug
						candidates with a covalent mechanism of
						action progressing through clinical trials
						or being approved by the FDA has grown
						significantly; around 30 % of the marketed
						drugs are covalent inhibitors. This kind of
						inhibition has many desirable features,
						including higher biochemical efficiency of
						target disruption, less sensitivity toward
						pharmacokinetic parameters and increased
						duration of action that outlasts the
						pharmacokinetics of the compound [1].
					</p>
					<p>
						Taking into account a growing interest and
						widespread use of fragment-fased drug
						discovery, Life Chemicals designed the
						Library of 1,300 Covalent Fragments based
						on The Stock Compound Collection. The
						design of selective covalent inhibitors is
						conceptually very attractive but in practice
						hard to achieve. That is because it is
						difficult to strike the right balance
						between reactivity and selectivity [2-4].
						Initially, The Life Chemicals Stock
						Collection was filtered according to “Rule
						of Three” criteria. Thereafter, a preliminary
						set of covalent fragments was created
						by singling out compounds with specific
						structural fragments (functional groups)
						[4-8] that are known to form covalent
						bonds with amino acid residues in binding
						sites of targeted proteins, e.g. Lys, Cys,
						Ser, His and Tyr. In addition, moleculeswith
						highly reactive electrophilic and
						nucleophilic groups (non-selective binders)
						as well as compounds with non-drug-like
						cores were discarded, using unwanted
						fragments and appropriate PAINS filters.

					<p>
						The following chemical classes and
						structural fragments were used for
						arraying potential covalent inhibitors:

					<p>
						A remarkable structural diversity and drug-likeness of molecular scaffolds identified in
						natural compounds provides a basis for the design of novel natural product-derived
						compound libraries for drug discovery [1,2]. Implementation of natural product-like
						frameworks into fragment-based drug discovery might benefit from using biologically
						validated areas of chemical space not occupied by average synthetic molecules [3,4].
					</p>
					<p>
						Life Chemicals presents a collection of Natural Product-like Fragments generated via
						Scaffold Tree approach [5]. More than 17,000 level-two and level-three scaffolds were
						extracted from The Universal Natural Product Database (comprising more than
						220,000 structures in its current version) [6] using scaffold tree analysis. After excluding
						undesirable and primitive chemotypes, the remaining ca. 4,000 structures were used
						for substructure search within The Life Chemicals Fragment Collection. In addition to
						that, fragments derived from scaffolds showing at least 85 % similarity with the natural
						product-derived scaffold set mentioned above were included as well. The resulting
						database was subject to additional structural filtering to give more than 3,200 natural
						product-like fragments.
